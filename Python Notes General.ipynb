    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Our Goal\n",
    "Walk through two examples of threading and multiprocessing to illustrate rules and best practices for taking advantage of concurrency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Concurrency?\n",
    "1. Improve perceived responsiveness\n",
    "1. Improve speed\n",
    "1. Because that is how the real world works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Martelli Model of Scaleability\n",
    "1. 1 core: Single thread and single process\n",
    "1. 2-8 cores: Multiple threads and multiple processes\n",
    "1. 9+ cores: Distributed processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Martelli’s observation: As time goes on, the second category becomes less common and relevant. Single cores become more powerful. Big datasets grow ever larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global Interpreter Lock\n",
    "CPython has a lock for its internal shared global state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unfortunate effect of the GIL is that no more than one thread can run at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For I/O bound applications, the GIL doesn’t present much of an issue. For CPU bound applications, using threading makes the application speed worse. Accordingly, that drives us to multi-processing to gain more CPU cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threads vs Processes\n",
    "“Your weakness is your strength and your strength is your weakness”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of threads is __shared state__. The weakness of threads is shared state (managing __race conditions__).\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of processes is their __independence__ from one another. The weakness of processes is lack of communication (hence the need for IPC and object pickling and other overhead).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threads vs Async\n",
    "#### Threads\n",
    "Threads switch __preemptively__. This is convenient because you don’t need to add explicit code to cause a task switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of this convenience is that you have to __assume__ a switch can happen at any time. Accordingly, __critical sections__ have to be guarded with locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The limit on threads is total CPU power minus the cost of task switches and synchronization overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Async\n",
    "Async switches __cooperatively__, so you do need to add explicit code `yield` or `await` to cause a task switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you control when task switches occur, so locks and other synchronization are no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the cost task switches is very low. Calling a pure Python function has more overhead than restarting a generator or awaitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that async is very __cheap__.\n",
    "\n",
    "In return, you’ll need a __non-blocking version__ of just about everything you do. Accordingly, the async world has a huge ecosystem of support tools. This increases the learning curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison\n",
    "- Async maximizes CPU utilization because it has less overhead than threads.\n",
    "- Threading typically works with existing code and tools as long as locks are added around critical sections.\n",
    "- For complex systems, async is much easier to get right than threads with locks.\n",
    "- Threads require very little tooling (locks and queues).\n",
    "- Async needs a great deal of tooling (futures, event loops, and non-blocking versions of just about everything)."

    "\n",
    "> #### Note: RR 1000\n",
    ">\n",

    "> Resources that need this technique: global variables, user input, output devices, files, sockets, etc.\n",

    "> One category of sequencing problems is to make sure that step A and step B happen sequentially. The solution is to put both in the same thread where all actions proceed sequentially.\n",

    "\n",
    "> #### Note: RR 1003\n",
    "> \n",
    "> You can’t _wait_ on daemon threads to complete (they are infinite loops). Instead, you `join()` on the queue itself. It waits until all the requested tasks are marked as being done.\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### Note: RR 1004\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Sometimes you need a _global variable_ to communicate between functions. Global variables work great for this purpose in a single threaded program. In multi-threaded code, the mutable global state is a __disaster__. The better solution is to use a `threading.local()` that is __global WITHIN a thread__ but not without.\n",

    "> #### Note: RR 1005\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Never try to kill a thread from something external to that thread. You never know if that thread is holding a lock. Python doesn’t provide a direct mechanism for kill threads externally; however, you can do it using ctypes, but that is a recipe for a deadlock.\n",

    "### What is parallelizeable?\n",
    "A __key pattern__ of thinking is to divide the world into to “lawn mowing” versus “baby making” – identifying tasks that are significantly parallelizeable versus those that are intrinsically serial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amdahl’s Law (according to wikipedia):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Amdahl’s law is often used in parallel computing to predict the theoretical speedup when using multiple processors. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> For example, if a program needs 20 hours using a single processor core, and a particular part of the program which takes one hour to execute cannot be parallelized, while the remaining 19 hours (p = 0.95) of execution time can be parallelized, then regardless of how many processors are devoted to a parallelized execution of this program, the minimum execution time cannot be less than that critical one hour. Hence, the theoretical speedup is limited to at most 20 times (1/(1 − p) = 20). For this reason parallel computing is relevant only for a low number of processors and very parallelizable programs.\n",
