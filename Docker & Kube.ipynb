    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawbacks\n",
    "- __Complexity__ of developing a distributed system\n",
    "    - Implementing inter-process communication\n",
    "    - Handling partial failures\n",
    "- Complexity of implementing business transactions that _span multiple databases_ (without 2PC)\n",
    "- Complexity of testing a distributed system\n",
    "- Complexity of deploying and operating a distributed system\n",
    "- Managing the development and deployment of features that span multiple services\n",

    "- How do clients of the application communicate with the services? \n",
    "- How to partition the system into services? \n",
    "- How to deal with distributed data management problems\n",

    "## Event-driven Microservices\n",
    "### Data management patterns\n",
    "__Single shared database__ or __Database per service__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shared Database\n",
    "![Shared Database](Asset/Microservices - Shared database.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Database per service\n",
    "    - each services should have its own private data that is only accessible through that service's API\n",
    "    - Loose coupling but more complex\n",
    "    - 2PC (aka. distributed transactions) is not viable choice for most modern applications - 2 Phase Commit / the cap the cap theorem / data consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event-driven architecture\n",
    "- Whenever something significant happens (state changes), publish an event\n",
    "- another service can consume this event and react accordingly, update its own data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use event-driven, eventually consistent order processing\n",

    "- __Problem__: How to atomically update database and publish an event?\n",
    "    - Dual write problem\n",
    "    - Tradition way: distributed transaction [Begin - update DB - update message broker - commit transaction]\n",
    "    - but no distributed transaction in modern application\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Reliably publish events when state changes\n",

    "\n",
    "- Reply events to recreate state\n",
    "    - Read Events to recompute the current state\n",
    "    - Periodically snapshot to avoid loading all events\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of event sourcing\n",
    "- Solves data consistency issues in a Microservices/NoSQL based architecture\n",
    "- Reliable event publishing: publishes events needed by predictive analytics etc, user notifications, ...\n",
    "- Eliminates O/R mapping problem (mostly)\n",
    "- Reifies state changes:\n",
    "    - Build in, reliable audit log\n",
    "    - temporal queries\n",
    "- Preserved history => More easily implement future requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawbacks of event sourcing\n",
    "- Requires application rewrite\n",
    "- Weird and unfamiliar style of programming\n",
    "- Events = a historical record of your bad design decisions\n",
    "- Must handle duplicate events: idempotent handlers or duplicate detection\n",
    "- Querying the event store can be challenging\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queries?\n",
    "- Find recent, valuable customers:\n",
    "```SQL\n",
    "SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERc, ORDER o \n",
